{"name":"MRBrew","tagline":"An Objective-C wrapper library for the Homebrew package manager.","body":"## MRBrew\r\nMRBrew is a simple Objective-C wrapper library for the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager.  It makes performing Homebrew operations from your apps a breeze:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[MRBrew performOperation:[MRBrewOperation installOperation:[MRBrewFormula formulaWithName:@\"vim\"]] delegate:self];\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you have a powerful text editor installed. :beer:\r\n\r\n## Project integration\r\nMRBrew can be integrated into an existing project using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Simply add the necessary dependency to your `Podfile` as follows:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nplatform :osx, '10.7'\r\npod 'MRBrew'\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen install the dependency into your project:\r\n\r\n`$ pod install`\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n`MRBrew` depends on Homebrew for the heavy lifting, and assumes the default installation path of `/usr/local/bin/brew` (though this can be specified in cases where the `brew` executable resides in a different location).  If you don't already have Homebrew installed, follow the [official instructions](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) to get setup.\r\n\r\n## General Usage\r\n\r\n#### Performing operations\r\nTo perform an operation, create and pass an instance of `MRBrewOperation` to the `MRBrew` class method `performOperation:delegate:`.  The `MRBrewOperation` class provides a number of convenience methods for creating instances that represent common Homebrew operations:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n+ (id)updateOperation;\r\n+ (id)listOperation;\r\n+ (id)searchOperation:(MRBrewFormula *)formula;\r\n+ (id)installOperation:(MRBrewFormula *)formula;\r\n+ (id)infoOperation:(MRBrewFormula *)formula;\r\n+ (id)removeOperation:(MRBrewFormula *)formula;\r\n+ (id)optionsOperation:(MRBrewFormula *)formula;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, the following code would perform a Homebrew `update` operation:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[MRBrew performOperation:[MRBrewOperation updateOperation] delegate:nil];\r\n```\r\n\r\nOperations that require a formula to be specified should be passed an instance of `MRBrewFormula`, which is just as easy to create. For example:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[MRBrew performOperation:[MRBrewOperation installOperation:[MRBrewFormula formulaWithName:@\"appledoc\"]] delegate:nil];\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach call to `performOperation:delegate:` spawns a subprocess that won't interrupt processing in the rest of your app.  Multiple operations can be performed concurrently by making repeated calls to `performOperation:delegate:`.\r\n\r\n#### Custom operations\r\nThe convenience methods provided by `MRBrewOperation` cover only a small subset of the actual operations supported by Homebrew.  To perform an operation that does not already have an associated convenience method defined use the following `MRBrewOperation` class method when creating your operation object:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n+ (id)operationWithName:(NSString *)name formula:(MRBrewFormula *)formula parameters:(NSArray *)parameters;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecify the operation name exactly as defined by Homebrew (e.g. `@\"upgrade\"`). Both `formula` and `parameters` may be optional dependent upon the operation being performed (see *man brew* for more details).\r\n\r\n#### Handling operation output\r\nYou'll probably want to be notified when an operation has finished, errored, or generated output.  This can be achieved using the delegate pattern by implementing the `MRBrewDelegate` protocol in your controller and specifying the following optional methods:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n- (void)brewOperationDidFinish:(MRBrewOperation *)operation;\r\n- (void)brewOperation:(MRBrewOperation *)operation didFailWithError:(NSError *)error;\r\n- (void)brewOperation:(MRBrewOperation *)operation didGenerateOutput:(NSString *)output;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, whenever you perform an operation with `performOperation:delegate:`, specify your controller object as the delegate in order to receive callbacks when an operation has finished, errored, or generated output:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[MRBrew performOperation:[MRBrewOperation updateOperation] delegate:controller];\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you expect your controller to manage (and therefore receive callbacks for) multiple types of operation, you should inspect the `MRBrewOperation` object in your delegate methods to determine how to respond:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n- (void)brewOperation:(MRBrewOperation *)operation didGenerateOutput:(NSString *)output\r\n{\r\n    if ([[operation name] isEqualToString:MRBrewOperationUpdateIdentifier]) {\r\n        // an update operation produced output\r\n    }\r\n    else if ([[operation name] isEqualToString:MRBrewOperationInstallIdentifier]) {\r\n        // an install operation produced output\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe constants referenced in the above snippet can be found in the `MRBrewConstants.h` header and used to determine the type of operation received by your delegate methods.  Import this header in your delegate implementation if you plan to use these constants.\r\n\r\nIf you are performing a custom operation that does not already have a constant defined simply provide your own, or use a literal:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\nif ([[operation name] isEqualToString:@\"audit\"]) {\r\n    // an audit operation produced output\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Cancelling operations\r\nOperations can be cancelled using one of the following `MRBrew` class methods:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n+ (void)cancelAllOperations;\r\n+ (void)cancelOperation:(MRBrewOperation *)operation;\r\n+ (void)cancelAllOperationsOfType:(MRBrewOperationType)operationType;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe delegate object for each operation that is cancelled will receive a message indicating operation failure &mdash; `brewOperation:didFailWithError:` &mdash; along with an `NSError` object whose code matches the `MRBrewErrorCancelled` constant.\r\n\r\n#### Miscellaneous\r\nIf the `brew` executable has been moved outside of the default `/usr/local/bin/` directory (generally not advisable), specify its location before performing any operations:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[MRBrew setBrewPath:@\"/usr/bin/brew\"];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis call only needs to be made once per project.\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\nIf you plan to contribute to the MRBrew project, [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), make your code changes, then submit a pull request with a brief description of your feature or bug fix.
